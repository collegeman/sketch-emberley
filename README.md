# A Sketch Template for making art in the style of Ed Emberley
I created a template. I want you to use it to make art.

## An ode to Ed Emberley
To a software engineer, the word "minimalism" means using less to achieve more: "fewer design elements, flat design, fewer options and features, and tendencially less occupied screen space." ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimalism#Software_and_UI_design))

When I was just a child "making art," I loved Ed Emberley. I still love him today. I love the freedom that comes of using a few strokes of a pen to transform a green circle into an expression of joy.

The illustrator and author of over 80 books, Emberley is a prolific instigator of playful creativity and art. In my opinion, his highest achievement is *[Picture Pie](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316789828/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i10)* in which he teaches illustration using just 4 simple, basic shapes:

And from these shapes, so much expression, so much freedom:

## Let's get sketching!
In my professiona life as a full stack developer, [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/) is one of my favorite tools. It allows me to prototype ideas at a range of resolutions. It also allows me to create art for fun.

In [the template](https://collegeman.github.io/sketch-emberley/emberley.sketch) you'll find Emberley's 4 basic shapes, as well as some extra ones I threw in for good measure:
