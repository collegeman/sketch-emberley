# An ode to the brilliant minimalism of Ed Emberley

To a software engineer, the word "minimalism" means using less to achieve more: "fewer design elements, flat design, fewer options and features, and tendencially less occupied screen space."

When I was just a child "making art," I loved Ed Emberley. I still love him today. I love the freedom that comes of using a few strokes of a pen to transform a green circle into an expression of joy.
