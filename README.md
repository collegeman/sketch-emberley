# A Sketch Template for making art in the style of Ed Emberley
I created a template. I want you to use it to make art.

## An ode to Ed Emberley
To a software engineer, the word "minimalism" means using less to achieve more: "fewer design elements, flat design, fewer options and features, and tendencially less occupied screen space." ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimalism#Software_and_UI_design))

When I was just a child "making art," I loved Ed Emberley. I still love him today. I love the freedom that comes of using a few strokes of a pen to transform a green circle into an expression of joy.

The illustrator and author of over 80 books, Emberley is a prolific instigator of playful creativity and art. In my opinion, his highest achievement is *[Picture Pie](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316789828/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i10)* in which he teaches illustration using just 4 simple, basic shapes:

And from these shapes, so much expression, so much freedom:

## Let's get sketching!
In my professiona life as a full stack developer, [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/) is one of my favorite tools. It allows me to prototype ideas in a range of resolutions. 

It also allows me to create art for fun.

In [the template](https://collegeman.github.io/sketch-emberley/emberley.sketch) you'll find Emberley's 4 basic shapes, as well as some extra ones I threw in for good measure:

I added the rectangular shapes because sometimes it's easier to just clone than resize. I added the thinner, line-like shapes because lines don't scale.

You can make your own shapes! Just layer up the basic ones, and then use the **Combine** tools (Union, Subtract, Intersect, and Difference) to merge the shapes together.

You can either combine the basic shapes as symbols and then use **Tinting** to color them, or detach the shapes from the symbols and color and style them any way you want.

## Create and share!
I don't own any of the rights to Ed Emberley's work. I've used screenshots of some of the pages of his books in this readme, and the image of "The Fox" below is a recreation of an image he published in the book *Picture Pie*.

I do own the Sketch file I created today, and you can use it to create any artwork you want to in the style of Ed Emberley. It is licensed ot you under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0.
